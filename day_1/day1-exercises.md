1. HTML code is the standard for laying out the structure and describing the presentation of information on a web browser.
2. An HTML element is one whole piece of the code. The element contains a start and end tag, attributes, and everything else in between the start and end tags. HTML tags provide a label for the element, and signal the start and end of one element.
3. Attributes are used to provide additional information regarding an element. They are used to add specificity such as names, and can be used to change an elements behavior.
4.

  i) The `<head>` element is used to tell the browser important information. None of the actual visual pieces of your webpage go here, however it is important if you are linking other pages; such as JS or CSS pages.

  ii) The `<title>` element goes within the head element, and is used to give the webpage a name that will show up in the browser.

  iii) the ``<body>`` element is where the bulk of the content will go within an HTML page. All of the other elements of the page will go within the body element.

5. in Google Chrome, you view the source of a website by right-clicking on the blank space of a web page, and selecting "page source". You can also click "inspect element" and view it there.

6.

    i) ``<h1>`` : This header element represents the first level of section headings. It is used to break up the size of different headings and keep it consistent. ``<h2>`` would be a slightly smaller heading than ``<h1>``.

    ii) ``<div>`` the Div element divides content so you can more easily separate different sections and styles of your webpage.

    iii) ``<a>`` the Anchor element creates hyperlinks so you can link other webpages or files to your webpage.

    iv) ``<br>`` This empty element produces a line break in the text (also called carriage-return line break).

    v) ``<strong>`` the Strong importance element indicates that the contents are of importance. Most browsers interpret this element as Bold typeface.

7. Empty elements are HTML elements that do not contain anything within them except for the opening tag. Empty elements cannot have any attributes.

8. Semantic markup is the idea that HTML tags are written to convey a meaning about their function and that HTML elements should be used for their intended purpose. The idea is that we do not use certain elements because of their visual style, but because of what they represent. Styling can be done in CSS if needed.

9. Three new semantic elements in HTML 5 are ``<section>``,``<time>``, and ``<aside>``.
