Chapter 2 Questions:

1. The syntax for declaring a JavaScript variable is `var someVariableName = someValue`. The equals sign is called an `assignment operator`, and it means you are assigning a value to something.

2. - Numbers: the numbers data type is used for numeric calculations and can include negative numbers and decimals.

  - String: the string data type is made up of letters and other characthers, and is represented within quotes.

  - Boolean: the boolean data type can have the value of `true` or `false`.

3. the six rules for naming variables are:
- the name must start with a letter, $, or underscore. It can't start with a number.
- the name cannot contain dashes or periods; but dollar signs, letters, and numbers are fine.
- you cannot name a variable after other JS keywords.
- variables are case sensitive.
- name your variable something that relates to the data it will be holding.
- use camelCase to name variables in Javascript.

4. Arrays are useful because they can store multiple values. If you have many related values, an array makes the information more easily understood than creating many individual variables. Values within an array can be accessed by specifying the index number you wish to access within square brackets.

5. The difference between an expression and a statement is that an expression evaluates into one value, while a statement represents an action (e.g printing, assigning, etc.).

6. The three operators are assignment, arithmetic, and string. Assignment operators assign values to variables. Arithmetic operators comlete numeric calculations. String operators combine strings to form another string.
