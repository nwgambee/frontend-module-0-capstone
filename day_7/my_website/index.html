  <h1>How to Golf</h1>
  <h2>by Noah Gambee</h2>
  <br>
  <p id="p1">Golf became a major part of my life when I was in middle school. After seeing me try to use right-handed golf clubs, my grandfather brought me home a set of left-handed ones. Although I am not left handed, the left handed golf swing was instantly more natural to me. After practicing for about a year, I joined the golf team at my high school. I loved the competition, the practice, and comradery with my teammates.
