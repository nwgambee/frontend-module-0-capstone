HTML Questions:

1. - Ordered lists: This type of HTML is used to organize a set of items in a specific order. The list is ordered with numbers, letters, roman numerals, etc..
  - Unordered lists: This type list should be used if you do not need to list your items in any particular order. This list uses bullet points or similar.
  - Definition lists: this one is helpful if you have multiple named items that you then wish to define. This HTML list will list a name, and then a definition below it.

2. `<a href="somelink.com"><Some Link></a>` is the standard structure to link another webpage using HTML. The `Some Link` is the text the user clicks on.

3. The `target` attribute within the opening `<a>` tag is used to make a link open in a new window when clicked. Ex: `<a href="somelink.com" target="_blank">Some Link></a>`

4. - By using `relative URL's`, you can link to different pages within the same website. Instead of entering a domain into the `href` attribute, you can enter the name of the HTML file. Ex: `<a href="contact_page.html"><Contact Us></a>`.
  - You can also link the specific parts of a page by labeling the sections of your HTML with id attributes, and then use that id in your href attribute.


CSS Questions:

1. CSS is used to create consistent styling and rules for the parts of your webpage. CSS rules include things like font, text position, text color, etc..
2. CSS stands for cascading stylesheets. Cascading means that styles can move or "fall" from one sheet/element to another.
3. The basic structure of a CSS rule is a selector followed by a declaration. The selector indicates which element of HTML this rule applies to, while the declaration indicates the specific styling.
4. A CSS page is linked to an HTML page by using the `<link>` tag in HTML. For example, this line of code - `<link href="sheet.css" type="text/css" ref="stylesheet" />` would link a CSS page called "sheet.css" to your HTML page.
5. External stylesheets are helpful when you have multiple pages in your site. This way, you can use a consistent style by linking the same CSS sheet to multiple HTML pages.
6. Hex color codes are a 6 digit value that represent a specific color by indicating how much red, green, and blue make up that color.
7. The three parts of an HSL color property are hue, saturation, and lightness.
8. The three main categories of fonts are serif, sans-serif, and monospace. With serif fonts, there are small details individual to each character, and are usually on the end of a character. Sans Serif have straight ends to all of the characters, and appear cleaner. In monospace fonts, each character takes up a fixed amount of space.   
9. The three units for font size are pixels, percentages, and EMS.
