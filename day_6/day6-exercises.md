Chapter 3 Questions:

1. In this example, the added parentheses at the end of `sayHello` are telling the console to run the function named `sayHello`. `sayHello` without the parentheses does not call the function.

2. Parameters are the information you add to a function that it will need to perform its task. Arguments are the specific values or variables that will go in place of the parameter when the function is called.

3. `return` is used to return a value to the code that called the function.

4. Local variables are better than global variables because they use less memory since the browser only has to remember them when they are in use, and it helps avoid naming collisions. A global variable might be useful if there is a certain variable that does not change and is being used in many of the codes functions.
