1. **Psychology**: *What habits are created if they do this over and over?*
- *Supporting Example*: `lumosity.com` - Lumosity encourages healthy habits to train your brain and develop healthier brain activity.
- *Violating Example*: `facebook.com` Facebook promotes negative addictive behavior through its UX.

2. **Usability** *Could you get the job done with less input from the user?*
- *Supporting Example*: `gmail.com` - GMail only asks for your email and password when loggin in, as simple as it gets.
- *Violating Example*: `geico.com` - this page has tons of links and input forms in the center of it, and makes it difficult to navigate without lots of scrolling and analysis by the user. 

3. **Design** *Do users think it looks good? Do they trust it immeadiately?*
- *Supporting Example*: `turing.io` - Even on my first visit to Turing's website, I noticed the minimalist look and ease of navigation.
- *Violating Example*: `amazon.com` - I find Amazon's UX to be messy and inconsistent, making it hard to efficiently navigate.

4. **Copywriting** *Is it clear, direct, simple, and functional?*
- *Supporting Example*: `twitter.com` - Twitter's browser interface eliminates almost everything except for the timeline, and is very direct.
- *Violating Example*: `reddit.com` - I find Reddit's default browser interface to be very cluttered and filled with things promoting Reddit, while also distracting the user from Reddit's main goal.

5. **Analysis** *Are you using data to prove that you are right, or to learn the truth?*
- *Supporting Example*: `nejm.org` - NEJM seems to organize their content in unbiased, scientific ways. The content of the website is purely scientific, and they do a good job of making that clear.
- *Violating Example*: `jennymccarthybodycount.com` - this site portrays data with unreliable sources in order to get their point across.
