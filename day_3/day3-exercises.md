1. Border is the thing that separates the end of one box from the edge of another. Margins exist outside the border, and create a gap between the borders of two boxes. Padding is the space between the border of a box and its contents.
2. 1px = top, 2px = right, 5px = bottom, 10px = left.
3. Block-level elements begin on new lines like paragraphs, while in-line elements do not break the content flow and instead occupy the space only defined by the tags.
4. Fixed positioning means that an element will stay in place depending on it's relation to the browser window. It does not move with other non-fixed elements. The Z-index is used to control which elements will appear on top.
5. Fixed layouts do not change size if the browser window size is changed, liquid layouts will adjust accordingly if the window size is changed.
